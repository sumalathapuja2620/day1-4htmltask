    <h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT IS FULL STACK?</h1>
    <center><img src="images/im.png" width="500px" height="300px"/></center>
    <p>Full stack development is the process of building both the front-end and back-end of an application.</p>
    <p><strong>*Front-end:</strong>The front-end is what users see.</p>
    <p><strong>*Back-end:</strong> the back-end is the database and logic.</p>
    <p><strong>*Database:</strong>Collections of data that can store words, numbers, images, videos, and files.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> WHAT IS STRUCTURE OF URL?</h1>
    <center><img src="images/url-structure-breakdown-digitrio.webp" width="500px" height="300px"/></center>
    <p>A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is an address on the internet that identifies a resource. The structure of a URL is made up of several components, including the protocol, domain, and path.</p>
    <h3>Components of a URL:-</h3>
    <p><strong>*Scheme:</strong>The protocol used to access the resource, such as HTTP or HTTPS.</p>
    <p><strong>*Domain:</strong> name of the host that contains the resource, such as www.example.com.</p>
    <p><strong>*Path:</strong> location of the resource on the host, such as /software/htp/cics/index.html.</p>
    <p><strong>*Query string:</strong>A string of information that the resource can use, such as search parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>*Sub-Domain</strong> A part of the domain that comes before the main domain.</p>
    <p><strong>*Top-level domain (TLD):</strong>The domain extension, such as .com, .org, or .net.</p>
    <p><strong>*Port:</strong> The network port used to connect to the resource .</p>
    <P><strong>*Fragment:</strong>A reference point within a file, such as an anchor in an HTML file.</P>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">HOW THE WORKS URL?</h1>
    <center><img src="images/download.webp" width="500px" height="300px"/></center>
    <p>When you enter a URL into a browser, the browser looks up the resource's IP address and sends a request to the server that hosts it. The server responds by sending the requested resource back to the browser. The browser then renders the resource as a web page. </p>
    <h3>Steps:-</h3>
    <p><strong>1.Enter the url:</strong>Type the URL into the browser's address bar.</p>
    <p><strong>2.Find the IP address:</strong>The browser uses a DNS lookup to find the IP address of the domain.</p>
    <p><strong>3.Establish a connection:</strong>The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server.</p>
    <p><strong>4.Send the request:</strong> The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.</p>
    <p><strong>5.Receive the response:</strong> The server processes the request and sends back a response.</p>
    <p><strong>6.Render the page:</strong>The browser renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the response to display the page.</p>
